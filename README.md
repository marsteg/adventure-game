# Adventure Game

an attempt to create a point and click adventure game in python  with pygame
You will need the pygame library. Then just run:
	 python3 main.py



# todo: 

- hitting space makes items shine
- I need to create room objects
	- rooms have items in them
	- once collected, item should not appear anymore in the room. 
		- in a room, i should only see items, that are not stashed
- need to find a clean way to assign and create doors and rooms and assign items (currently in main func)

## inventory
- items should get ordered / aligned in the inventory
