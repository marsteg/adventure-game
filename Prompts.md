## Items
I'm working on an point and click adventure game. you are my graphics designer. The Adventure Game is set in a comic-style look in a fantasy world. 
The current chapter plays out in a school for magical beings like werewolves, vampires, wizards, trolls, elves, dwarfs.
Can you please generate a picture with a black background and four items: 
- a magical plant with green fruits growing from it. The Plant should not be bigger than a table plant
- a handfull of straw
- a piece of paper that was torn from a book
- a book with a brown leather cover and a title on it written in gold: "The book of Truth"
